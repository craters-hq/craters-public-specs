# Theme Conquest Rules (WIP)

Cycle: announce → submissions → live ranking → finale (R_future awards).  
Inputs: unique tagged acks, saves/dwell (bounded), views (capped), recency decay.  
Allocation: pool B_R_future split by rank; emit THEME_R_AWARD receipts.

## TODO
- [ ] Publish weights & decay
- [ ] Tie-break rules and appeals
